		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">Hello.</h2>
		<p>As a designer turned founder, I naturally come at business from the perspective of product.</p>
		<p>In fact, since 14 I’ve been building things. Whether as a venture, for work or just for fun.</p>
		<p>Having worked with a few businesses to get their tech products off the ground, and running a half-serious clothing line during my school years which grew to 30,000 odd customers and a few hundred thousand pounds in revenue, I took the bold step into my first tech startup in 2017.</p>
		<p>That company, Study Rocket, set out to change the way students learn. The rollercoaster saw us raise capital and scale quickly, only to find out we were building something no one wanted.</p>
		<p>No problem. Luckily we had been responsible: keeping cash burn low and learning incredibly fast. So, we pivoted. And formed an entirely new company and product, called Adapt.</p>
		<p>Adapt is a simple idea — a calendar app that plans all of a student’s work for them. As CEO, I saw the company through the pivot, beta iterations, another successful funding round, public launch and ultimately to profitability.</p>
		<p>I then took the bold (and scary as sh*t) move to take a step back from the business, leaving it in the very capable hands of my cofounder, Maud.</p>
		<p>I now help Maud guide the business to it’s potential, from arms length, as the Executive Chairman.</p>
		<p>Taking a step back from Adapt has allowed me to use my time to give back what I’ve learned over the last few years.</p>
		<p>Combining my functional (design, coding and growth) and leadership (strategy, business and people) skills I’m able to add a lot of value to tech startups that need more hands on deck.</p>
		<p>When I’m not working (something I’m bad at making a reality), I’m hiking, reading, swimming, playing tennis, or trying to discover new music.</p>
		<p>Oh, or attempting to learn Spanish.</p>
