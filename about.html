		<h1 class="pagetext__header">About me</h1>
		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">Hello.</h2>
		<p>I'm James.</p>
		<p>As an ex-designer, product manager and developer, I come at business from the angle of product.</p>
		<p>In fact, since 14 I’ve been <a href="/designer">building things</a>. Whether as a venture, for work, or for fun.</p>
		<p>I worked with a few businesses to get their tech products off the ground. I ran a half-serious clothing line during my school years, which had 30,000 fanatic fans and a few thousand in monthly revenue. And then, in 2016, I started my first tech startup.</p>
		<p>That company, <a href="https://www.studyrocket.co.uk" target="_blank">Study Rocket</a>, set out to change the way students managed their work. We raised capital and scaled to 30,000 users quickly, only to find out we were building something no one wanted.</p>
		<p>Luckily, we had hired incredible people, kept cash burn low, and learning fast, enabling us to pivot to an entirely new product, <a href="https://www.getadapt.co.uk" target="_blank">Adapt</a>.</p>
		<p>Adapt was a simple idea, a calendar app that would plan all of a student’s work for them. As CEO, I saw the company through the pivot, beta iterations, another successful funding round, public launch and, ultimately, to profitability.</p>
		<p>I later decided to take a step back from the business, leaving it in the very capable hands of my cofounder, Maud.</p>
		<p>I now help Maud drive the business to its full potential, from arms length, as Chairman.</p>
		<p>Taking a step back from Adapt allowed me to give back what I learnt over the three years building the company.</p>
		<p>Taking my functional skills (design & code) and strategy, I've been helping numerous startups figure out their product strategy and, in some cases, building it with them.<p>
		<p>Since COVID-19, my friend Pete and I set up <a href="https://www.dishpatch.co.uk" target="_blank">Dishpatch</a> to help the vulnerable with food delivery and small suppliers with business. Dishpatch has gone from 0 to 250+ suppliers and 70,000 users in the last month.</p>
		<p>When I’m not working (something I’m bad at making a reality), I’m hiking, reading, swimming, playing tennis, or trying to discover new music. Or attempting to speak Spanish...</p>
