		<h1 class="pagetext__header">About me</h1>
		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">Hello.</h2>
		<p>I'm James. A product manager turned founder.</p>
		<p>As a long-time designer and product manager, I naturally come at business from an angle of product.</p>
		<p>In fact, since 14 I’ve been <a href="/designer">building things</a>. Whether as a venture, for work, or for fun.</p>
		<p>I worked with a few businesses to get their tech products off the ground. I ran a half-serious clothing line during my school years, which grew to 30,000 odd customers and a few hundred thousand pounds in revenue. And then, in 2016, I started my first tech startup.</p>
		<p>That company, <a href="https://www.studyrocket.co.uk" target="_blank">Study Rocket</a>, set out to change the way students learn. We raised capital and scaled to 30,000 users quickly, only to find out we were building something no one would use.</p>
		<p>Luckily we had been responsible. By hiring incredible people, keeping cash burn low, and learning fast, we were able to pivot to an entirely new product, called <a href="https://www.getadapt.co.uk" target="_blank">Adapt</a>.</p>
		<p>Adapt was a simple idea, a calendar app that would plan all of a student’s work for them. As CEO, I saw the company through the pivot, beta iterations, another successful funding round, public launch and, ultimately, to profitability.</p>
		<p>I have since taken a step back from the business, leaving it in the very capable hands of my cofounder, Maud.</p>
		<p>I now help Maud drive the business to its full potential, from arms length, as Chairman.</p>
		<p>Taking a step back from Adapt has allowed me to use my time to give back what I’ve learned over the last few years.</p>
		<p>Combining my functional (design, coding and growth) and leadership (strategy, business and people) skills, I’m able to add a lot of value to tech startups that need more hands on deck.</p>
		<p>When I’m not working (something I’m bad at making a reality), I’m hiking, reading, swimming, playing tennis, or trying to discover new music. Or attempting to speak Spanish...</p>
