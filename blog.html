		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">What I write about</h2>
		<p>We’re all constantly learning new things as we embark on untrodden or new territory in our startup journey.</p>
		<p>For too long I’ve kept these learnings to myself, or never really fully contextualised them into somewhat of an explanation.</p>
		<p>That's why I started to write the odd blog post.</p>
		<p>This blog is mainly to help founders navigate the beginning of starting a company, scaling their product organisation and focusing their effort where it matters most.</p>
		<p>If you find my posts helpful, do <a href="#">subscribe to my mailing list</a> to stay up to date as I write.</p>
