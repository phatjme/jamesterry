		<p>As a two-time startup CEO & board member coming from a background of product, design and development, I tend to be most helpful to tech startups that need support in the following areas:</p>
		<ul class="pagetext__list">
			<li class="list">Product strategy</li>
			<li class="list">Design & branding</li>
			<li class="list">Business modelling</li>
			<li class="list">Growth and marketing</li>
			<li class="list">Go-to-market strategy</li>
			<li class="list">Early stage foundations (raising money, hiring and strategy)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">How does it work?</h2>
		<p>I’ve never charged for advising. I believe in giving back what you learn to the entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
		<p>As an advisor you could count my support when you need it, whether over a call, a lunch or a game of tennis!</p>
		<p>Obviously, time is limited. So I only work with companies that I’m excited about and I feel I can add value. The criteria I typically look for is:</p>
		<ul class="pagetext__list">
			<li class="list"><strong>Product-first companies</strong> - you care, above all, about building a product that people value.</li>
			<li class="list"><strong>Early stage</strong> - you’re in the first few years of your journey, perhaps with a pre-seed/seed raise.</li>
			<li class="list"><strong>Traction & progress</strong> - you’re actually executing your idea and showing great progress.</li>
			<li class="list"><strong>Great people</strong> - you’re a team of intelligent, resilient and humble people.</li>
		</ul>
