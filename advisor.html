		<p>As a two-time startup CEO & board member coming from a background of product, design and development, I tend to be most helpful to tech startups that need support in the following areas:</p>
		<ul class="pagetext__list">
			<li class="list">Product strategy</li>
			<li class="list">Design & branding</li>
			<li class="list">Business modelling</li>
			<li class="list">Growth and marketing</li>
			<li class="list">Go-to-market strategy</li>
			<li class="list">Early stage foundations (raising money, hiring and strategy)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">How does it work?</h2>
		<p>I never charge for advising. I strongly believe in giving back what you learn to the entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
		<p>As an advisor you could count my support as and when you need it, whether over a call, a lunch, or a game of squash!</p>
		<p>Obviously, time is limited. So I only work with companies that I’m excited about and feel I can add value. What I typically look for:</p>
		<ul class="pagetext__list">
			<li class="list"><strong>Product-first companies</strong> - you care, above all, about building a product that people value.</li>
			<li class="list"><strong>Early stage</strong> - you’re in the first few years of your journey, perhaps with a pre-seed/seed raise.</li>
			<li class="list"><strong>Traction & progress</strong> - you’re actually executing your idea and showing great progress.</li>
			<li class="list"><strong>Great people</strong> - you’re a team of super intelligent, resilient, humble people.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">Interested in working together?</h2>
		<p>If you think we're a good fit, <a href="mailto:james@jamesterry.co.uk">email me</a> with a short blurb on what you do, who you are and where you’d like my help.</p>
		<p>I may also be able to help with investment, if you're raising a round, see if you're a good fit <a href="/investor">here</a>.
