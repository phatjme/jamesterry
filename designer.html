		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">How I can help</h2>
		<p>I'm an incredibly quick, attentive and aesthetic designer coming from a background of business.</p>
		<p>When I'm designing websites, web apps and iOS/Android apps I often add a lot of value through suggestions and iterations. While designing/developing, I go through a rigorous process of prototype interviews, beta releases and production analytics to make sure the apps I build are <i>really</i> working for their users.</p>
		<p>In other words, I do a lot more than just the design/development.</p>
		<p>I'm open for work on new projects at the moment. If you need help from a UI designer, product manager or front-end developer, <a href="mailto:james@jamesterry.co.uk">get in touch</a>!</p>
