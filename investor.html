		<h2 class="pagetext__subheader">How I invest</h2>
		<p>I invest small tickets into early stage tech companies. I try to add value on top of my investment by providing support/advice where I can. I also tend to introduce my investments to my network of HNW angels, VCs and founders.</p>
		<p>What I typically look for in new investments:</p>
		<ul class="pagetext__list">
			<li class="list">Incredible founder(s) - resilient, smart yet humble founders.</li>
			<li class="list">Radical simplicity - solving a <strong>single</strong> problem, really f*cking well.</li>
			<li class="list">Clear distribution strategy - an obvious distribution strategy or an inherently viral product.</li>
			<li class="list">Network effects - baked in to the way the product has been designed to build a moat.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Match my investment criteria?</p>
		<p>Get in touch with a blurb & your deck. I don’t need an introduction, as a founder I know how hard they can be to get!</p>
